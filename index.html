<div class="developer border">
  <h3>Developer</h3>
  <p>I'm a developer at <a href="http://hactar.is/">Hactar</a>, where I help organisations with a social conscience build digital products.</p>
  <p>I'm one of <a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/ones-to-watch-2017">Code First: Girls' Ones to Watch 2017</a> and my love affair with CSS is going to be be made into a <i>Titantic</i>-esque romantic epic any day now.</p>
