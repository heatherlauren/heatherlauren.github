<h1>Hi, I'm Heather</h1>

<h2>I'm a writer and developer. I live in London with my girlfriend and our two cats.</h2>

<h2>Writer</h2>
<p>I write about politics, tech and pop culture. If I'm really lucky, I get to write about all three at once.</p>
<p>I'm a regular contributor for <a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/">Autostraddle</a>, and my work has been featured by <a href="http://www.polygon.com/">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://theestablishment.co/">The Establishment</a> and the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/">Huffington Post</a>.</p>

<h2>Developer</h2>
<p>I'm a Developer at <a href="http://hactar.is/">Hactar</a>, where I spend my days building digital products for organisations with a social conscience.</p>
<p>I also speak on ethical issues and ongoing learning in the tech industry, and my love affair with CSS is going to be be made into a <i>Titantic</i>-esque romantic epic any day now.</p>
